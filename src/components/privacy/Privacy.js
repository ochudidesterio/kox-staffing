        to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have
        come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a
        third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the
        success of e-mail marketing campaigns]. In many instances, these
        technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so
        declining cookies will impair their functioning.
